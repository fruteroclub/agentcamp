# AgentCamp.xyz Landing Page React Component Generator

## Instructions

Using the content and instructions provided for each section of the AgentCamp.xyz landing page, generate the corresponding React components. Each section should be a separate functional component, utilizing modern React best practices and hooks as needed. Use TypeScript for type safety.

The components should be styled using Tailwind CSS utility classes. Incorporate the suggested visual elements and layout as CSS-in-JS or inline styles.

After generating the individual section components, create a root `LandingPage` component that imports and renders all the sections in the specified order. This root component should be wrapped in any necessary layout or provider components.

Finally, update the `app/page.tsx` file to import and render the `LandingPage` component. This will serve as the entry point for the landing page.
